# MonoKey - Secure Password Manager

MonoKey is a modern, secure password manager that gives you complete control over your data. With zero-knowledge encryption and secure cloud storage, it's the only password manager you'll ever need.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **One Key to Rule Them All**: Remember just your MonoKey and access all credentials
- **Secure Cloud Storage**: Encrypted cloud storage with 99.9% uptime guarantee
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: AES-256 encryption with client-side decryption only
- **Password Generation**: Create strong, unique passwords with customizable options
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Access your passwords from any device, anywhere
- **Advanced Security**: 2FA backup codes, recovery options, and secure sharing

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

- All credential data is encrypted using AES-256 with PBKDF2 key derivation
- MonoKey is hashed using SHA-256 and never stored in plain text
- Data is decrypted only on the client-side after MonoKey verification
- Zero-knowledge architecture ensures even we can't access your data

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account (for authentication and cloud storage)
